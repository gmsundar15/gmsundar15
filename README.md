# About Me
My Name is Sundar Gurumurthy. I am a manufacturing engineer by profession. I am interested in looking at projects related to multi physics simulations and am an avid Linux enthusiast. 

# Current Projects
## Improved Inherent Strain Method for Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing
Inherent Strain Method is a way to predict the distortion and stress distribution in manufactured parts using the strain field as an input. The core principle is taking advantage of the geometric compatibility of strains. If accurate strains are used as an input on the design geometry, the geometry would automatically equilibrate to state that is representative of actual distortion which would happen during a process. There are several challenges in applying this method to 3-D Printing/Additive Manufacturing.\
**Repository with scripts for automating FEM models in Abaqus coming soon!**.

# Past Coding Projects
## Bevel Gear flank design with theoretically ideal Spherical Involute profile
Bevel gears are usually manufactured in large quantities through gear cutting processes. These processes, however, are unable to achieve the ideal tooth geometry due as gears are usually cut in 2-D for manufacturing efficiency but the ideal geometry is a 3-D curve. However, processes such as forging can manufacture the ideal geometry in most cases, though they do induce errors of about 20 microns on the surface topography. I developed a proprietary software for developing the surface mesh of the spherical involute flanks in Python. This software supports several types of crowning to optimize contact patterns. The software also provides a streamlined workflow for designing the gear parameters and size (macro-design) and develops 2-D CAD drawings automatically. The software also performs Tooth Contact Analysis for visualizing the theoretical contact pattern. The software integrates seamlessly with Siemens NX for 3-D CAD and simulations, and automatically generates design reports for the PLM software Siemens TeamCenter.

I developed this project during my free time at work as a project to automate my gear design work. My goal was to use it to replace commercial software which my employer was using with a custom software which better represented my company's workflow. Since I developed this using equipment and resources provided by my employer during my work hours, I don't own any of it and hence can't share it here even though I want to. 

## M.D. Simulation of evaporation through Porous Media
Simple project which simulates evaporation of water through micro-pores on a molocular level. The original idea was to expand on this simulation to include saline water so that a process to desalinate water can be developed. The simulation is done through scripting in LAMMPS with some code on MATLAB.\

# Future Plans
I am not very good at programing user applications. But I am currently learning more and hope to contribute to some open source projects in the future. I have a really big goal of developing a open source fork of Android for use in E-readers. I hope to get there in about 2028, completely by learning and working on my free time.
